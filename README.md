# collection-of-auto-commands
system made for no apparent reason that can be used in combo whit hotcuts or any other macro 

this is a collection of bash, python, c++ scripts that will be used as commands to run from a macro

# how does it work

audio.sh:
you will have to create a file full of noises (i put anime girl noises) and then in line 1 the path to the directory
if you run the script from a macro it will play in backgroung whitout opening the terminal a random noise
go read the script for further understanding
